//? In JavaScript, Dynamic Programming (DP) is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and reusing the results where needed. This is useful in optimization problems, where we aim to find the best solution from many possible solutions.

//* Memoization: (Top-Down) recursively breaks the problem down but caches results to avoid redundant calculations.

//* Tabulation: (Bottom-Up) builds up the solution iteratively, also avoiding redundant calculations.
